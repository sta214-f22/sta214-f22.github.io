Anxiety can affect musicians before performances, and can negatively affect their ability to play and their emotional state. In a [2010 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550610370492), researchers examined anxiety in 37 undergraduate music majors. For each musician, data was collected on anxiety levels before different performances (between 2 and 15 performances were measured for each musician). Each row in the data represents one performance, and variables include

* `id`: a unique identifier for the musician
* `na`: negative affect score (a measure of anxiety)
* `large`: whether the musician was performing as part of a large ensemble (large = 1), or as part of a small ensemble or solo (large = 0)

**Question:** Are there systematic differences in anxiety between musicians, or are observed differences due to chance?

To answer this question, we will conduct a simulation, in which we generate new data under the assumption that there are *no* systematic differences in anxiety between musicians.

### Data

The following code imports the data and saves it as a data frame called music:

```{r eval=F}
music <- read_csv("https://sta214-f22.github.io/slides/musicdata.csv")
```

# Part I

1. To begin, let's visualize the data. Fill in the following code to create boxplots showing the distribution of anxiety scores (the `na` variable) for each musician in the data:

```{r eval=F}
music %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ...,
             y = ...)) +
  geom_...() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Musician",
       y = "Anxiety")
```

2. Next, let's estimate the variability between musicians. Fill in the following code to fit the random intercepts model
$$Anxiety_{ij} = \beta_0 + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij} \hspace{1cm} u_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_u^2), \ \ \varepsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$

```{r eval=F}
m1 <- lmer(... ~ ..., data = music)
summary(m1)
```

3. What is the estimated intra-class correlation?

We want to know whether the observed boxplots and intra-class correlation are evidence that there are systematic differences in anxiety between musicians. To answer this question, we will investigate whether the observed data is *unusual*, if in fact there are no systematic differences between musicians. Our strategy is to:

* Fit a model *without* a random effect
* Use the fitted model to *simulate* a new dataset
* Compare the simulated data to the observed data. If the observed data looks different from the simulated data, maybe there are systematic differences in anxiety between musicians

4. Fill in the following code to fit the intercept-only linear model (no random effect)
$$Anxiety_{ij} = \beta_0 + \varepsilon_{ij} \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$

```{r eval=F}
m0 <- lm(... ~ ..., data = music)
summary(m0)
```

5. What are the estimates $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_\varepsilon^2$ from the model in exercise 4?

6. Now let's generate a new dataset. Fill in the following code to simulate new data, where the simulated anxiety is given by
$$Anxiety_{ij}^* = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \varepsilon_{ij}^* \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_{ij}^* \sim N(0, \widehat{\sigma}_\varepsilon^2)$$

```{r eval=F}
new_na <- ... +
  rnorm(n=..., mean=0, sd=...)

new_data <- data.frame(id = music$id,
                       na = new_na)
```
