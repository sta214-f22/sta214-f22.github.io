## Overdispersion

In this class activity, we will work with data on crimes at 81 US colleges and universities. Our data includes the following variables:

* `type`: college (C) or university (U)
* `nv`: the number of violent crimes for that institution in the given year
* `enroll1000`: the number of enrolled students, in thousands
* `region`: region of the US C = Central, MW = Midwest, NE = Northeast, SE = Southeast, SW = Southwest, and W = West)

We are interested in comparing the crime rates in different US regions. Our model is

$$Crimes_i \sim Poisson(\lambda_i)$$

$$\log(\lambda_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 MW_i + \beta_2 NE_i + \beta_3 SE_i + \beta_4 SW_i + \beta_5 W_i + \log(Enrollment_i)$$
Below are the results of fitting the model with Poisson regression, and with the quasi-Poisson modification to account for overdispersion.

```{r include=F}
library(tidyverse)

crimes <- read_csv("~/Documents/Teaching/sta279-s22.github.io/slides/c_data.csv")
```

```{r}
m1 <- glm(nv ~ region, offset = log(enroll1000),
          data = crimes, family = poisson)
summary(m1)
```

```{r}
m2 <- glm(nv ~ region, offset = log(enroll1000),
          data = crimes, family = quasipoisson)
summary(m2)
```

1. What is our estimated dispersion parameter, $\widehat{\phi}$? Do you think there is overdispersion in our data?

2. Confirm that the standard errors for the quasi-Poisson fit are equal to $\sqrt{\widehat{\phi}}$ times the standard errors for the Poisson fit.

3. We are interested in comparing crime rates for western and central schools. Calculate an appropriate confidence interval.
