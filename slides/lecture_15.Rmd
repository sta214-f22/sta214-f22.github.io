### Motivation

.large[
**Question:** What is the relationship between age and contraceptive use for women in Indonesia?

**Data:** 1473 Indonesian couples, with variables
* $Y_i$ = contraceptive method used (1 = no use, 2 = long-term, 3 = short-term)
* $X_i$ = Wife's age (numeric)
]

hook_output <- knit_hooks$get("output")

### Multinomial regression model

.large[
**Step 1: Choose a reasonable distribution for $Y$**

$$Y_i \sim Categorical(\pi_{i(None)}, \pi_{i(Short)}, \pi_{i(Long)})$$
**Step 2: Choose a model for any parameters**

$$\log \left( \dfrac{\pi_{i(Long)}}{\pi_{i(None)}} \right) = \beta_{0(Long)} + \beta_{1(Long)} Age_i + \beta_{2(Long)} Age_i^2$$
$$\log \left( \dfrac{\pi_{i(Short)}}{\pi_{i(None)}} \right) = \beta_{0(Short)} + \beta_{1(Short)} Age_i + \beta_{2(Short)} Age_i^2$$

### Fitting the model in R

.large[
* To fit a multinomial regression, we use the `nnet` package

```r
library(nnet)
```

* Syntax is very similar to other regression techniques

```r
m1 <- multinom(Choice ~ WifeAge + I(WifeAge^2), 
               data = cmc_data)
```
]

---

### Fitting the model in R

.large[
When you fit the model, you get the following output:

```{r}
m1 <- multinom(Choice ~ WifeAge + I(WifeAge^2), 
               data = cmc_data)
```

* This reflects the process used to estimate the model parameters -- we won't get into that here

### Generalizing

.large[
Let $Y_i \sim Categorical(\pi_{i1}, ..., \pi_{iJ})$ be a categorical variable with $J$ levels, and let $j^*$ be the reference level. For each $\pi_{ij}$, $j \neq j^*$, we model

$$\log \left( \dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{\pi_{ij^*}} \right) = \beta_{0(j)} + \beta_{1(j)} X_i$$
Then $\pi_{ij} = \pi_{ij^*} \exp\{ \beta_{0(j)} + \beta_{1(j)} X_i \}$, so

$$\pi_{ij^*} = \dfrac{1}{1 + \sum_{j \neq j^*} \exp\{ \beta_{0(j)} + \beta_{1(j)} X_i \} }$$
$$\pi_{ij} = \dfrac{\exp\{ \beta_{0(j)} + \beta_{1(j)} X_i \}}{1 + \sum_{j \neq j^*} \exp\{ \beta_{0(j)} + \beta_{1(j)} X_i \} }$$

### Predicted probabilities in R

.large[
We can obtain the predicted probabilities for each individual in the data:

```{r}
probspred <- fitted(m1)
```

Here are the predicted probabilities for the second individual:

```{r}
probspred[2,]
```

```{r}
probspred[2,]
```

This is a 24 year old woman who does not use contraceptives.

How well did we do at estimating their chances of using contraception?

]

### Making predictions

.large[
```{r echo=F}
probspred[2,]

.large[
* If we don't have any data, our estimated probability would be 1/3 for each level
* If we have data but we don't use age, our estimated probability for each level is just the proportion of observations in that group:

```{r}
table(cmc_data$Choice)/nrow(cmc_data)
```

### Moral

.large[
* By itself, accuracy isn't particularly useful for summarizing prediction performance
* We need to look at predictive ability for each class
