### Data

.large[
Using information from the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, we are interested in studying the relationship between an individual's age and whether or not they use contraceptives.

The data come from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice)

### Data

.large[
Using information from the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, we are interested in studying the relationship between an individual's age and whether or not they use contraceptives. 

Information on 911 husband-wife couples, with wife aged between 20 and 35, and variables including:

* Contraceptive method used (0 = none, 1 = some use)
* Wife's age (in years)
* Husband's age (in years)
* Wife's education (1 = low, 2, 3, 4 = high)
* Husband's education (1 = low, 2, 3, 4 = high)
* Number of children ever born
]

---

### Data

.large[
**Research question:** What is the relationship between wife's age and the use of contraceptives?

**Response variable:** Contraceptive use (0 = no, 1 = yes)

**Explanatory variable:** Wife's age (in years)
]

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.question[
What plot can we use to visualize the response (contraceptive use)?
]

**Answer:** Bar chart

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
cmc_data <- read_csv("cmc.data.txt", col_names = F)

cmc_data$Choice <- ifelse( cmc_data$Choice == 1, "None", ifelse(cmc_data$Choice==2, "Short", "Long"))
cmc_data$ChoiceBin <- ifelse(cmc_data$Choice =="None", 0 , 1)
cmc_data <- cmc_data %>% 
  filter(WifeAge >= 20, WifeAge <= 35)

cmc_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(ChoiceBin))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Contraceptive use?") +

### Class activity, Part I

.large[
[https://sta214-f22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html](https://sta214-f22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html)

In the class activity, you'll start to explore the relationship between age and contraceptive use.

Spend a few minutes to do the following:

* Say hi to the people around you, introduce yourself
* Work in groups on **Part I** of the class activity (questions 1 -- 3)
* You don't need to submit your work
]

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability of contraceptive use?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1) =$
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability that a couple will use some contraception, given that the wife is 20 years old? What about if the wife is 30 years old?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 20) =$

$P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 30) =$
]

## Odds

.large[
.question[
What are the (empirical) odds of contraceptive use, if the wife's age is 20 years old? 30 years old?
]
]

---

### Conceptual question

.large[
.question[
If the *odds* of an event are $> 1$, what is true about the *probability* of that event? Go to [https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637](https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637) to respond.
]

.abox[
(A) probability $> 1$
]

.bbox[
(B) probability $> 0.25$
]

.cbox[
(C) probability $> 0.5$
]

.dbox[
(D) probability $> 0.75$
]

]

---

### Conceptual question

.large[
.question[
Probabilities are always between 0 and 1. What range of values can *odds* take? Go to [https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637](https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637) to respond.
]


.abox[
(A) Between 0 and 1
]

.bbox[
(B) Between 0 and $\infty$
]

.cbox[
(C) Between $-\infty$ and $\infty$
]

.dbox[
(D) Between 0 and 2
]
]

### Class activity, Part II

.large[
Spend a few minutes working in groups on Part II of the class activity (questions 4 -- 6)

[https://sta214-f22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html](https://sta214-f22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html)

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What range of values can the log odds take?
]
]

---

### Conceptual question

.large[
.question[
If the *probability* of an event is $> 0.5$, what is true about the log odds? Go to [https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637](https://pollev.com/ciaranevans637) to respond.
]

.abox[
(A) log odds $> 0$
]

.bbox[
(B) log odds $> 1$

]

.dbox[
(D) log odds $< 0$
]
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
True or false: if the log odds are an increasing function of $X$, then the probability is also an increasing function of $X$.
]
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
**Logistic regression:**
.center[
$\log \left( \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age}$
]

.question[
In general, why is it not appropriate to model the probability, or the odds, as a linear function of the predictor?
]
]

### Extensions and late work

.large[
**Extensions:** You have a bank of **5** extension days, which you may use over the course of the semester. You may use either one or two days for a given assignment. *Additional extensions may be given, on an individual basis, in extenuating circumstances.*

**Late work:** An assignment will be marked off 20% for every 24 hours it is late (past the original due date).

If you know you cannot turn in an assignment (for instance, if you are ill or there is a family emergency), let me know before the assignment is due, and we will work something out. There will be no grade changes
after our last day of class.
